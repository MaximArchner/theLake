                <h3 id="Paradise"> Paradise</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Rusty Lake Paradise is the twelfth game by Rusty Lake and the third premium game. It is set in the same Rusty Lake location as the Cube Escape games, but is not considered part of the series, instead being a stand-alone game with some connections.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The game takes place in 1796 on an isolated island in Rusty Lake. The story is based around 10 plagues, thought to be a variation of the ten plagues of Egypt, which curses the island and its inhabitants after the main character's mother mysteriously dies. The player must interact with their family members around the island and partake in many ominous rituals in order to stop the plagues.</p>
                <h3 id="Roots"> Roots</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Rusty Lake: Roots is the tenth game by Rusty Lake and the second premium game. It is set in the same Rusty Lake location as the Cube Escape games, but is not considered part of the series, instead being a stand-alone game with some connections.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The game takes place in the late 19th and early 20th century in the Vanderboom House, located in the Rusty Lake area. During the game, the player must help the Vanderbooms grow their family tree through the years, spanning three generations. At the end of the game, there are several gold family emblems that the player can collect to unlock a special level, involving the beginning of the family tree.</p>
                <h3 id="Hotel"> Hotel</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">Rusty Lake Hotel is the seventh game by Rusty Lake and the first premium game. It is set in the same Rusty Lake location as the Cube Escape games, but is not considered part of the series, instead being a stand-alone game with some connections.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The game takes place in 1893 at the Rusty Lake Hotel, a large manor house on an island in the middle of Rusty Lake. During the game, the player must prepare and serve meals to the five guests by finding meat and collecting optional ingredients. A number of stars are awarded for each meal, depending on the number of optional ingredients obtained.</p>

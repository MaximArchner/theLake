# theLake
The Lake is a parody webpage of the game company named Rusty Lake from Amsterdam, Holland. The games of Rusty Lake are point &amp; click adventures in which you discover the mysteries of a supernatural place called Rusty Lake. This website is a student project of mine and I get no profit from it. It's a parody page.

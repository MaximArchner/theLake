                <p>Rusty Lake is both the name of our indie game studio and the eerie and surrealistic world we have created. Rusty Lake is both the name of our indie game studio and the eerie and surrealistic world we have created.</p>

                   <p>Since spring 2015 we have developed 15 surrealistic adventure games that take place in the Rusty Lake universe. Inspired by David Lynch's TV series Twin Peaks we decided to create our own imaginative universe called Rusty Lake. We tried to bring something new to the point-and-click genre by by adding suspense and atmosphere to the "escape room" setting and releasing our series of games as part of a larger story.</p>

                    <p>At the heart of our accomplishments and success is the Rusty Lake community. Since the beginning of Rusty Lake, we have involved our community as much as possible and constantly find new ways to make them feel part of our universe. Our community supported us in creating our first premium game: Rusty Lake Hotel and helped us reach our Kickstarter goal for Paradox, in just 9 hours. The amount of fan art we receive is overwhelming and we still can't believe we have fans with Rusty Lake tattoos. We are so honored to be part of, and supported by this ever-growing community.</p>
